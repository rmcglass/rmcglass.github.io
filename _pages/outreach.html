I am very passionate about exploring different creative forms of scientific outreach. Science should be for everyone, 
  which is why I believe in creating accessible opportunites for the general public to learn about the nature of our universe. 
  Along with speaking to middle and high school science classes, I have created outreach materials for radio and outdoor education settings. 
  A summary of my outreach activities can be found in my <a href="https://rmcglass.github.io/cv/">CV</a>, but I have highlighted some of my favorites below:</p>

  <h2> Science Writing for a General Audience </h2>
  <hr>
  <p> 
    <img src="/images/NASMblog_planetstar.jpg" alt="Blog title: "Why is a Planet Not a Star?"" style="float: right; width: 340px; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 15px; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 15px">
    At the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, education is a central part of our mission. In my opinion, an important part of doing scientific research 
    is not only sharing it with the scientific community, but the general public as well. The Air and Space Museum curates a blog on their website that is contributed to
    by many of the research scientists, historians, and educators who work here where we write about topics or answers questions that are often asked by museum visitors. A recent blog of mine
    is titled <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/why-planet-not-star">"Why is a Planet Not a Star?"</a> and discusses differences in formation histories of planets and stars, as well as a few interesting edge cases.

  <h2> Astronomy on Tap: Cradle of Astronauts </h2>
  <hr>
  <p> 
    <img src="/images/AoT_WestLafayette_circle_full.png" alt="Astro on Tap Cradle of Astronauts logo" style="float: right; width: 340px; padding: 15px">
    Astronomy on Tap is an organization that presents informal space-related talks by professional scientists aimed at the general public, 
    taking place at local bars or breweries. There are many satellite locations around the world that are affiliated with the larger Astronomy on Tap umbrella, and 
    in Fall 2021, I started our very own satellite event series in Lafayette, Indiana! Along with another grad student, I organize the event locations, A/V setups, 
    presenters, and other trivia or games that we have at each event. Follow us on <a href="https://https://twitter.com/AoT_CoA">Twitter</a> for more information 
    and event updates!

    Why the name? Purdue University is known as the "Cradle of Astronauts" – 26 astronauts are Purdue alumni,
    and a Purdue alum has flown on about a third of all U.S. spaceflights. These include both commercial and NASA astronauts, and I think 
    I would be breaking some unspoken Purdue rule if I didn't mention that Neil Armstrong is a Purdue alum as well.

<h2> Astronomy Ranger: Exploring the dark skies of Bryce Canyon National Park </h2>
<hr>
<p>Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah was recently classified as a dark sky park by the International Dark-Sky Association, 
  which is a testament to the clarity of its night skies as well as its commitment to darky sky education and conservation. 
  Nearly 80% of North Americans can't see the Milky Way, but at Bryce Canyon it is almost a nightly occurance. </p>

<p>As an astronomy ranger intern in the summer of 2019, I spent 5 nights a week at the rim of the canyon showing visitors the night sky through telescopes. 
  Visitors of all ages came (usually about 150 each night!), and we had great discussions about the planets, stars, black holes, our galaxy, and the 
  stories we tell about constellations. I also led monthly full moon astronomy hikes into the canyon at night, lit only by moonlight. During the day, 
  we would use solar telescopes to allows visitors the chance to safely look at the sun and teach them about sunspots and solar activity. I also got the 
  opportunity to develop an evening program, which I would present biweekly to 80-100 visitors as a part of the park's normal programming as well as 
  during the Bryce Canyon Astronomy Festival, which draws thousands of visitors each year to the park's dark skies. 
  This program was titled "A Message to the Universe" and used the journey of the Voyager missions and the golden record to take audiences on a 
  grand tour to the outer edge of our solar system.

<h2>Radio Astronomy: Astronomy outreach + college radio
</h2>
<hr>
<blockquote>Macalester's very own grassroots community astro talk show on WMCN. Hop on the shuttle as we blast off every week, exploring a supermassive 
  topic in modern (astro)physics. We’ll cover it all- from the formation of the universe to the search for life, and everything in between. Anyone who 
  wants to make contact with the cosmos should tune their receiver to ν = 91.7 MHz (λ = 3.27 m) in Saint Paul, MN or navigate to https://www.wmcn.fm/ for
  an hour of discovery. No previous knowledge necessary!
</blockquote>

<p>I have always loved public radio for its freedom to produce a variety of content without being reliant on advertisers. At Macalester College, 
  I found college radio to be an especially good platform to experiment with different ways of communicating science to general audiences. 
  Radio Astronomy was started by three intrepid astronomy students: Catie Ball, Alex Gordon, and Liz Ruvalo. These three were inspired by the content 
  of their astrophysics class and wanted to share it with the rest of Macalester students as well as the surrounding community. I joined Catie and Alex 
  as the third cohost in season 2 of the show, and as my cohosts graduated and moved on to doing other incredible science, I took on new cohosts 
  (Sarah Taft, then Josh Bartz and Nick Velikonja) and Radio Astronomy continued on the air through a 5th season. Due to the coronavirus pandemic 
  limiting access to the studio, Radio Astronomy is on a hiatus, but I hope that it will return someday.
