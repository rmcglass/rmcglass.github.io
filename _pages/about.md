## Welcome!

My current research interests involve radar and planetary ices, specifically using subsurface radar observations, lab experiments, and analog field work to understand how ice deposits near the Martian poles may answer questions about Mars' enigmatic climate history. 

I received my PhD in planetary science in Fall 2024 at Purdue University in the Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, where I worked with professor Ali Bramson studying radar observations of Mars' polar regions. I earned my B.A. in physics with an emphasis in astronomy and a math minor from Macalester College in May 2020. There, my research interests took me on a tour of our local universe, exploring bulk kinematics of dwarf galaxies, small-scale plasma eruptions in the Solar corona, and finally performing observations of near-Earth asteroids at the Arecibo Observatory. 

Informal education is also something I am very passionate about! I have enjoyed developing general-audience astronomy programs through different mediums. Some [highlights](https://rmcglass.github.io/outreach/) include hosting Radio Astronomy, an astronomy talk radio program on Macalester College Radio (WMCN 91.7 FM St. Paul, MN), and an internship as an astronomy ranger at Bryce Canyon National Park in the summer of 2019.

In my free time I also enjoy exploring our National Parks, playing with my cat (Ash), and playing roller derby for the Lafayette Roller Derby Supernovas as #24 Mars Madness.
